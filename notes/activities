SH // Review proto byte size for user object properties

FA > Created a simple http server
FA > Create the rotes in route.go
FA > Started handling request with handler.go

FA > Conflicted about using nested object in proto file because of the 2 byte for over 16 reserved numbers, nested object will be harder to unmarshal since the front end is sending JSON - Graph QL might be a better object - but for now I would continue - in the future can modify the proto and handle the unmarshalling
